# Hexo Theme Library

>This theme is inspired by the concept of [hexo-theme-book](https://github.com/wujun234/hexo-theme-tree/tree/8ba3aa395cc0527787b3b369522d689675b40f32) and initially a fork from it. Though the two repo may seem to differ a lot with each other now, the basic idea are still the same.

This theme will organize and display your posts according to the file path, which mean the file structure under `source/_posts/` directory.

## Instructions

Download the theme to the `themes` directory under the root directory of your hexo project.
```
git clone https://github.com/berman82312/hexo-theme-library.git  themes/library
```

Modify the `_config.yml` under the root directory of hexo project.
```
theme: library
```
